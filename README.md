# hello-world
I am enrolled in 'Data Science Specialisation' @ John Hopkins University...provided by Coursera. This exercise of creating my first repository is part of the first course which teaches, among other things, how to use Github

After creating repository 'hello-world' I have created a branch to practice creating a branch and editing this README.md.
I find Data really interesting, and I am actively seeking a base knowledge of available tools to aid me in my Data Science journey.
